Stippling is a drawing in which dots are placed carefully to simulate the density of an image. This project is an implementation of Adrian Secord's Weighted Voronoi Stippling paper. I implemented the stippling algorithm by implementing GPU-based Lloyd's method to generate centroidal Voronoi diagrams.

If you feed the points into a TSP solver, you get this weird design
